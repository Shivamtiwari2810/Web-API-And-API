    "* GET Method:\n",
    "The GET method is used to retrieve data from a specified resource. In other words, it is used to request data from a server without changing the state of the resource. When you enter a URL into your browser and hit enter, a GET request is sent to the server and the server returns the requested resource. GET requests can be cached, and they remain in the browser history. They can also be bookmarked and shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "* POST Method:\n",
    "The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server. In other words, it is used to send data to the server to update or create a resource. For example, when you submit a form on a website, a POST request is sent to the server with the form data. Unlike GET requests, POST requests cannot be bookmarked or cached, and they do not remain in the browser history."

    "In Flask, the request object is used to access incoming request data that is submitted from a client to a Flask application. It provides an easy way to access the values submitted by the user through HTML forms or JSON data submitted via APIs.\n",

    "The request object is an instance of the Request class, which is part of the werkzeug library that Flask is built on top of. It provides access to information such as form data, cookies, headers, and files uploaded as part of the request. The request object can be accessed from within a view function, which is a Python function that handles a specific request URL."

    "In Flask, templates are used to separate the presentation layer from the business logic of a web application. Templates are files that define the structure and layout of an HTML page, and can include placeholders for dynamic data. Flask uses a templating engine to render these templates and fill in the dynamic data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To render a template in Flask, you use the render_template() function, which is a built-in function in the flask module. The render_template() function takes the name of the template file as its first argument, and any additional variables that you want to pass to the template as keyword arguments."
